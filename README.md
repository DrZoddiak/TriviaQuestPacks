# TriviaQuestPacks
A repository of packs available for Trivia Quest

# Contributing New packs?
If you're wanting to contribute new packs please follow this guide.

Use a consistant "theme" for your packs. Vanilla, Math, Pokemon, etc...

Try and create a standard for Names for example in my vanilla pack I try to use [Type]-[Name]-[Detail]
This lessens the chances of new entries conflicting.

When generating questions allow for multiple answers if applicable.
ex. For my Vanilla pack I ask "How many legs does a creeper have?" and I allow "4, 4 legs, four, four legs" as options in attempt to encompass possible ways a player may answer the question. 

If you're going to make "Mod Themed" packs. Please either make it Mod specific, or Pack specific.

# Editing Existing Packs?
If you're modifying existing packs please follow this guide

Please state why you are making your change. Is the question not related to the theme? Is the answer in-correct for the question?

Don't make changes to the repository for questions you don't want for your server. You can just modify your own.
